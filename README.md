There is a requirements.txt. I got it like this:
```bash
pip install pipreqs
pipreqs . --force
```

to use it:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate    # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

then 

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The python package's code is in `T5Code` and the tests are in the `tests` directory.

I use black to fix my quotes:
```bash
pip install black
black .
```

To test this code, you can do 
```bash
python -m unittest
```
and then
```bash
coverage run -m unittest discover
coverage report
```
or
`coverage html`
then open file:///htmlcov/index.html in a browser

Looking for TDD'd code, look no further.

There is a test simulator/Game called GameState.py.
Run it like this:
```bash
python GameState.py
```
It outputs a journal of activities taken by one starship.

This code will eventually be used by a simpy discrete-event simulation of thousands of starships in an Imperium.
